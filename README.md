## F1/10 Driving Straight
- Go to <b>f1tenth-rubis/src/drive_straight</b> folder in order to explore race project.

### Testing Hector SLAM
- In <b>f1tenth-rubis/src/hector_slam_launch_example</b> folder.
- Fixed sample launch files and uploaded with proper sample bag file.
- Missing lots of other filse. This folder is just for saving.
- goStaight.bag doesn't work with this tutorial.launch example. I suspect it is because we did not record tf topic when we ran the robot in the hallway.
